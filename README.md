# Huffman-Coding Personal Project

a lossless data compression algorithm, using data structures like trees and linked lists in `C++`.

Huffman Coding is an approach to text compression originally developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Ph.D. student at MIT, and published in the 1952 paper "A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes". In computer science and information theory, it  is one of many lossless data compression algorithms.  It is a statistical compression method that converts characters into variable length bit strings and produces a prefix code. Mostfrequently occurring characters are converted to shortest bit strings; least frequent, the longest.
